# JMM2020
Presentation and images for my presentation, "Curve stitching variations in 2D and 3D," at JMM 2020 in Denver, CO on January 15, 2020. 

The presentation is image heavy.  The code for creating the images in the presentation can be found in the *images* folder.  The code consists of Python scripts, Java in a basic Eclipse package, and POV-Ray examples. Please be aware that the code was written late at night in a frenzy fueled by caffiene and pizza, so it may not be the most readable code.  I plan on cleaning up the code as time permits.
